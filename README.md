# RISC-V (RV32I) Processor in VHDL

This repository contains the implementation of a 32-bit, single-cycle processor that follows the base RISC-V instruction set specification (RV32I). The project is developed entirely in VHDL (2008 standard) and is intended as an educational tool for studying computer architecture.

The design is modular, with each main processor component (ALU, Register File, Control Unit) implemented in its own file. Each module is accompanied by a self-verifying testbench to ensure correctness before final integration.

## 🎯 Goals and Features

* **Target ISA:** RISC-V RV32I (Base Integer Instruction Set).
* **Language:** VHDL-2008.
* **Focus:** Design clarity and educational purposes.
* **Verification:** Self-verifying testbenches for each component.
* **Automation:** Fully automated compilation and simulation flow via `Makefile`.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows to separate the hardware design (RTL), simulation, and software.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To compile and simulate this project, you will need the following tools installed and available in your system's PATH:

1. GHDL: An open-source VHDL simulator.

2. GTKWave: A waveform viewer for debugging.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Simulate (Using the Makefile)

The Makefile automation simplifies the entire workflow. All commands should be run from the project's root directory.

### 1. Clean the Project
Before starting a new build, it is good practice to clean up all previously generated files.
```bash
make clean
```
This command will delete the `build/` directory, ensuring that no old files interfere with your simulation.

### 2. Run a Simulation (Unit Tests)

This is the main command for verification. It compiles the hardware and then compiles and runs a specific testbench.
```bash
make sim TB=<testbench_name>
```

Replace `<testbench_name>` with the name of your testbench file in the `sim/` folder, **without the `.vhd` extension**.

```bash
make sim TB=alu_tb
```

This command will perform the following steps:

1. Compile all files in rtl/.
2. Compile and run sim/alu_tb.vhd.
3. Generate a waveform file at build/wave-alu_tb.ghw.
4. Display the testbench output in the terminal, including messages from ASSERT statements (indicating PASS or FAIL).
